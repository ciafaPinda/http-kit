Special items can be obtained in different ways, such as completing quests, exploring ruins, trading with other factions, or looting enemy ships. However, some players may want to access these items more easily, either for modding purposes or for cheating. In this case, knowing the special item ID list can be very helpful.
 
The special item ID list is a numerical code that corresponds to each special item in the game. By using the console commands or editing the game files, players can add any special item they want to their inventory or to a specific building. For example, if a player wants to add the "Golden Ship" item, which gives a bonus to trade income and attractiveness, they can use the console command `additem 100000`, where 100000 is the ID of the item.
 
The following table shows the complete special item ID list for Anno 1404, along with their names, descriptions, and effects. Note that some items may have different effects depending on the game version or the expansion pack installed.

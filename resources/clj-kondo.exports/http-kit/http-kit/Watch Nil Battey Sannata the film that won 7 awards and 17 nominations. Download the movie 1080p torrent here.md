## Nil Battey Sannata: A Review
 
Nil Battey Sannata is a film that celebrates the power of dreams and the bond between a mother and a daughter. The film follows the journey of Chanda, a maid who works hard to provide for her daughter Apu, who is a reluctant student with no interest in studies. Chanda wants Apu to pursue higher education and become an independent woman, but Apu believes that she is destined to follow her mother's footsteps and become a maid herself.
 
Chanda's life changes when she meets Dr. Diwan, a kind-hearted woman who employs her as a maid and encourages her to enroll in Apu's school as a student. Chanda decides to take up the challenge and joins Apu's class, much to the latter's embarrassment and annoyance. Chanda hopes that by studying with Apu, she can motivate her to improve her grades and inspire her to dream big.
 
The film depicts the struggles and joys of Chanda and Apu as they navigate their new roles as classmates and competitors. The film also showcases the support and friendship they receive from their teacher Mr. Srivastava, played by Pankaj Tripathi, and their fellow students. The film has many humorous and emotional moments that touch the hearts of the viewers.
 
The film's strength lies in its realistic and relatable portrayal of the lives of the lower-class people in India. The film does not shy away from showing the hardships and challenges they face on a daily basis, such as poverty, discrimination, and lack of opportunities. The film also highlights the importance of education as a tool for empowerment and social change.

The film's performances are another highlight of the film. Swara Bhasker delivers a stellar performance as Chanda, a woman who is determined to give her daughter a better life than hers. She portrays Chanda's strength, vulnerability, and love with conviction and grace. Riya Shukla is equally impressive as Apu, a rebellious and cynical teenager who undergoes a transformation as she learns to appreciate her mother's sacrifices and efforts. The chemistry between Bhasker and Shukla is natural and endearing. Pankaj Tripathi adds charm and humor to the film as Mr. Srivastava, a supportive and witty teacher who guides Chanda and Apu along their journey.
 
The film's direction, cinematography, music, and editing are also commendable. Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari makes a remarkable debut as a director with this film. She captures the essence of the story with simplicity and sensitivity. Gavemic U. Ary's cinematography brings out the beauty and contrast of the cityscape and the countryside. Rohan-Vinayak's music complements the mood and tone of the film. Chandrashekhar Prajapati's editing keeps the pace and flow of the film smooth and engaging.
 
Nil Battey Sannata is a film that will make you laugh, cry, and cheer for its characters. It is a film that will make you think about your own dreams and aspirations. It is a film that will make you appreciate your own mother and her unconditional love for you.

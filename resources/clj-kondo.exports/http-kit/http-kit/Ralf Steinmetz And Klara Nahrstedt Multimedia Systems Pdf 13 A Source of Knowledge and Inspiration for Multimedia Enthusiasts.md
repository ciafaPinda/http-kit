Multimedia Systems is a book that provides a comprehensive overview of the basic characteristics of multimedia operating systems, networking and communication, and multimedia middleware systems. The book aims to give a broad understanding of multimedia systems and applications in an integrated manner, covering topics such as quality of service, multimedia operating systems, media servers, networks, communication, group communication, synchronization, multimedia security, and user interfaces. The book is written by Ralf Steinmetz and Klara Nahrstedt, who are both experts in the field of multimedia systems and have extensive experience in industrial research and development, as well as academic teaching and publishing.
 
The book is divided into eight chapters, each focusing on a different aspect of multimedia systems. The first chapter introduces the basic concepts and terminology of multimedia systems, such as media types, media formats, media processing, media presentation, media synchronization, media quality, and media adaptation. The second chapter discusses the quality of service (QoS) requirements and mechanisms for multimedia applications, such as QoS models, QoS parameters, QoS architectures, QoS negotiation, QoS adaptation, QoS monitoring, and QoS management. The third chapter presents the design principles and techniques for multimedia operating systems, such as scheduling algorithms, resource management, memory management, file systems, device drivers, and middleware support. The fourth chapter describes the functionality and architecture of media servers, such as data placement strategies, disk scheduling algorithms, buffer management policies, caching techniques, replication methods, and fault tolerance mechanisms. The fifth chapter explains the network protocols and services for multimedia communication, such as network layer protocols (IP), transport layer protocols (TCP/UDP), streaming protocols (RTP/RTCP), application layer protocols (HTTP/RTSP), network services (DNS/DHCP), multicast services (IGMP/PIM), and network security (IPSec/SSL). The sixth chapter explores the group communication aspects of multimedia systems, such as group coordination algorithms (centralized/distributed), group membership protocols (static/dynamic), group addressing schemes (unicast/multicast/anycast), group synchronization methods (master/slave/peer-to-peer), group communication models (client/server/publish-subscribe), and group security issues (authentication/authorization/encryption). The seventh chapter examines the synchronization issues and solutions for multimedia systems, such as synchronization models (intra-stream/inter-stream/end-to-end), synchronization methods (clock-based/event-based/hybrid), synchronization algorithms (skew control/delay control/rate control), synchronization protocols (NTP/RTP/RTCP), synchronization standards (MPEG/SMPTE/ISO), and synchronization tools (lip sync/audio sync/video sync). The eighth chapter reviews the user interface design and evaluation for multimedia systems, such as user interface components (widgets/windows/menus/toolbars), user interface styles (command-line/graphical/web-based), user interface paradigms (direct manipulation/hypertext/hypermedia), user interface guidelines (consistency/feedback/error prevention), user interface evaluation methods (usability testing/heuristic evaluation/cognitive walkthrough), and user interface evaluation tools (questionnaires/interviews/observations).

One of the most popular entries in the series is Corpse Party: Blood Covered, which is a remake of the original game with improved graphics, voice acting, and story. This game was released for Windows in 2008, but it was never officially localized in English. However, there are ways to download and play this game on your PC with fan translations and patches.
 
In this article, we will show you how to download Corpse Party: Blood Covered for PC and enjoy this horror masterpiece.
 
## Step 1: Get the Game Files
 
The first step is to get the game files from a reliable source. You can buy the game from Steam[^1^], which is the easiest and safest option. However, if you want to play the original Japanese version or use a different fan translation, you will need to find another source. We do not condone piracy, so please support the developers if you can.
 
Once you have the game files, extract them to a folder on your PC. You will need a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip to do this.
 
## Step 2: Apply the Translation Patch
 
The next step is to apply the translation patch that will change the game's language to English. There are several fan translations available online, but we recommend using the one by Memories of Fear[^2^], which is the most complete and accurate one.
 
To apply the patch, download it from their website and extract it to the same folder where you extracted the game files. Then, run the patcher.exe file and follow the instructions. The patcher will automatically detect and modify the game files to make them compatible with English.
 
## Step 3: Run the Game
 
The final step is to run the game and enjoy it. To do this, simply double-click on CorpseParty.exe file in your game folder. You might need to change some settings in the config.ini file, such as screen resolution, window mode, and sound volume. You can also use keyboard shortcuts to adjust these settings in-game.

# Wavefunction Spartan 16: A Powerful Tool for Molecular Modeling
 
Wavefunction Spartan 16 is a software application that allows users to perform various tasks related to molecular modeling, such as conformational analysis, structure optimization, spectral analysis, graphical surfaces, and property calculations. Wavefunction Spartan 16 is based on the latest release of the Spartan Parallel Suite, which offers a full range of theoretical models from the most intuitive user interface in the business[^1^]. Wavefunction Spartan 16 can interface with several databases, such as the Spartan Spectra and Properties Database (SSPD), which contains more than 300,000 molecules with pre-calculated structures, energies, and spectra[^2^]. Wavefunction Spartan 16 can also act as a computational server for jobs submitted from other Spartan licenses or iSpartan apps on mobile devices[^3^]. Wavefunction Spartan 16 is designed for chemistry research and education in industry and academia.
 
In this article, we will review some of the features and benefits of Wavefunction Spartan 16 and show some examples of how it can be used for molecular modeling.

One of the main applications of Wavefunction Spartan 16 is conformational analysis. Conformational analysis is the study of the different shapes that a molecule can adopt due to rotation around single bonds. Conformational analysis is important for understanding the structure, stability, reactivity, and interactions of molecules. Wavefunction Spartan 16 can perform conformational analysis using various methods, such as systematic search, Monte Carlo sampling, molecular dynamics simulation, and quantum mechanics optimization. Wavefunction Spartan 16 can also generate conformational energy profiles and potential energy surfaces to visualize the energy landscape of a molecule. Wavefunction Spartan 16 can handle molecules with up to 200 atoms for conformational analysis.
 
Another application of Wavefunction Spartan 16 is structure optimization. Structure optimization is the process of finding the most stable geometry of a molecule that minimizes its energy. Structure optimization is essential for predicting the properties and behavior of molecules. Wavefunction Spartan 16 can perform structure optimization using various levels of theory, such as molecular mechanics, semi-empirical methods, density functional theory, and ab initio methods. Wavefunction Spartan 16 can also perform geometry optimization with constraints, such as fixed bond lengths, angles, or dihedrals. Wavefunction Spartan 16 can handle molecules with up to 500 atoms for structure optimization.

A third application of Wavefunction Spartan 16 is spectral analysis. Spectral analysis is the study of the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with matter. Spectral analysis is useful for identifying and characterizing molecules based on their absorption or emission of light. Wavefunction Spartan 16 can perform spectral analysis using various methods, such as infrared (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis), and mass spectrometry (MS). Wavefunction Spartan 16 can also simulate and compare spectra with experimental data and assign peaks to molecular vibrations or transitions. Wavefunction Spartan 16 can handle molecules with up to 1000 atoms for spectral analysis.
 
A fourth application of Wavefunction Spartan 16 is graphical surfaces. Graphical surfaces are visual representations of various properties or functions of a molecule in three-dimensional space. Graphical surfaces are helpful for exploring the shape, size, charge, polarity, reactivity, and solvation of molecules. Wavefunction Spartan 16 can generate graphical surfaces using various types, such as electron density, electrostatic potential, molecular orbitals, spin density, HOMO-LUMO gap, Fukui functions, and solvent-accessible surface area. Wavefunction Spartan 16 can also customize the color, transparency, and resolution of graphical surfaces.

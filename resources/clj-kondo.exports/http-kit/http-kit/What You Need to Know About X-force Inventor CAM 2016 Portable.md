## DWG Compare Tool
 
One of the most useful features of AutoCAD 2019 is the DWG Compare tool. This tool allows you to compare two versions of a drawing and highlight the differences in color. You can also toggle between the compared drawings and see the changes in real time. This is very helpful for reviewing changes made by others, checking revisions, or identifying errors.

To use the DWG Compare tool, you need to open two drawings that you want to compare. Then, go to the Collaborate tab and click on DWG Compare. A new drawing will be created that shows the comparison results. You can use the toolbar at the top to change the comparison settings, such as the colors, the types of objects to compare, and the margin of error. You can also use the Previous and Next buttons to navigate through the differences.
 
## Shared Views Feature
 
Another great feature of AutoCAD 2019 is the Shared Views feature. This feature lets you share your designs online with stakeholders and collaborators without uploading your files to the cloud. You can create a link to your drawing that can be viewed in any web browser. The viewers can comment, measure, mark up, and print your drawing without having AutoCAD installed on their devices.
 
To use the Shared Views feature, you need to save your drawing and go to the Collaborate tab. Then, click on Shared Views and follow the steps to create a new shared view. You can name your view, choose what to include, and set an expiration date. Once your view is created, you can copy the link and send it to anyone you want to share it with. You can also manage your shared views from the Shared Views palette or from your Autodesk account.

## AutoCAD Web App and Mobile App
 
Another way to access and edit your drawings from any device and location is to use the AutoCAD web app and mobile app. These apps are included with your AutoCAD subscription and allow you to work on your drawings online or offline. You can use the same tools and commands that you are familiar with in AutoCAD desktop, such as draw, modify, annotate, measure, and snap. You can also sync your files with cloud storage services such as Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive.
 
To use the AutoCAD web app, you need to go to web.autocad.com and sign in with your Autodesk account. You can then open your files from your computer or from the cloud. You can also create new drawings from scratch or from templates. To use the AutoCAD mobile app, you need to download it from the App Store or Google Play and sign in with your Autodesk account. You can then open your files from your device or from the cloud. You can also use the camera to scan drawings or capture images.
 
## Performance and Stability Improvements
 
Finally, AutoCAD 2019 comes with enhanced performance and stability improvements that make it faster and more reliable than ever. Some of the improvements include:

- Faster startup time and smoother user interface.
- Faster 2D graphics display and selection.
- Faster 3D graphics display and navigation.
- Faster saving and opening of large drawings.
- Fewer crashes and errors.

These improvements make AutoCAD 2019 more responsive and efficient for your daily work.

There are two ways to unlock Samsung Infinion 1.0.0.5: by using an unlocking code or by using an unlocking software.
 
### Unlocking Code Method
 
This method requires you to obtain an unlocking code from an online service or your network provider. The unlocking code is a unique sequence of numbers that corresponds to your phone's IMEI number (a 15-digit code that identifies your device). To get the unlocking code, you need to:

1. Find your IMEI number by dialing \*#06# on your phone or by checking the settings or the box of your phone.
2. Visit an online unlocking service such as [UnlockBase](https://www.unlockbase.com/) or [DoctorSIM](https://www.doctorsim.com/) and enter your phone model, network provider, country, and IMEI number.
3. Pay a small fee and wait for the unlocking code to be emailed to you (usually within a few hours or days).
4. Insert a different SIM card into your phone and turn it on.
5. Enter the unlocking code when prompted by your phone.
6. Your phone is now unlocked and ready to use with any SIM card.

### Unlocking Software Method
 
This method requires you to download and install an unlocking software on your computer and connect your phone to it via USB cable. The unlocking software will automatically detect your phone and unlock it in a few minutes. One of the best unlocking software for Samsung devices is [T-UnLock](https://t-unlock.com/), which supports all new security Samsung devices including Samsung Infinion 1.0.0.5. To use T-UnLock, you need to:

1. Download and install T-UnLock on your computer from [https://t-unlock.com/](https://t-unlock.com/).
2. Create an account and buy some credits (the price depends on the model and network of your phone).
3. Enable USB debugging mode on your phone by going to Settings > Developer options > USB debugging (if you don't see Developer options, go to Settings > About phone > Software information and tap on Build number seven times).
4. Connect your phone to your computer via USB cable and launch T-UnLock.
5. Select your phone model and click on Unlock.
6. Wait for the process to complete (it may take a few minutes).
7. Your phone is now unlocked and ready to use with 8cf37b1e13

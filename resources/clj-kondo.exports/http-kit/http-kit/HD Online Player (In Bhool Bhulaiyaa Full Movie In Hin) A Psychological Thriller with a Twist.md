Avni opens a locked room on the third floor that contains Manjulika's belongings. She gets possessed by Manjulika's spirit and starts behaving strangely. She dances like Manjulika and tries to seduce Siddharth. She also attacks Radha and Badri's wife Janki. The family members suspect Radha of being behind these incidents and blame her for trying to ruin Siddharth's marriage.
 
Siddharth calls his friend Dr. Aditya Shrivastav, a psychiatrist, to help him solve the mystery. Aditya arrives at the palace and pretends to be a fool to make everyone laugh. He secretly investigates the case and finds out that Avni is suffering from dissociative identity disorder, a condition in which she has two personalities: one of herself and one of Manjulika. He also learns that Avni had a traumatic childhood, as her father used to abuse her mother and her. She developed a fascination for Manjulika's story and unconsciously identified with her.
 
Aditya decides to cure Avni by making her face her past and confront her father's ghost. He also arranges a fake exorcism to make Avni believe that Manjulika's spirit has left her body. He succeeds in his plan and Avni returns to her normal self. However, he discovers that there is another twist in the tale: Manjulika was not a Bengali dancer, but a Tamilian Brahmin who was forced to dance by Raja Vibhuti Narayan. She was actually in love with a Bengali sculptor named Shashidhar, who was killed by the king. Manjulika's spirit had been waiting for Shashidhar's reincarnation, who turns out to be none other than Aditya himself.
 
Aditya realizes that he has fallen in love with Avni and decides to sacrifice himself for her happiness. He goes to the third floor and confronts Manjulika's spirit, who tries to kill him. He manages to free himself from her grip and locks her up in the room again. He then reunites with Avni and Siddharth, who thank him for saving their lives. Aditya bids them farewell and leaves the palace with a heavy heart.

# How to Download and Use Thumbs.db Files for Burnout Paradise
 
Thumbs.db files are small database files that store thumbnail images of the files and folders in a directory. They are used by Windows Explorer to speed up the display of thumbnails and icons. However, sometimes these files can get corrupted or damaged, causing errors or missing thumbnails.

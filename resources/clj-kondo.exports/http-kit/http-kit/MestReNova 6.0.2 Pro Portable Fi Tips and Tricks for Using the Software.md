MestReNova 6.0.2 Pro Portable Fi has many advantages over other NMR software. First of all, it is portable, which means you can run it from a USB drive or a CD without installing it on your computer. This makes it convenient to use on different machines and platforms. Second, it is compatible with most NMR formats, such as Bruker, Varian, JEOL, Agilent, and others. You can easily import and export your data without losing any information. Third, it has a user-friendly interface that allows you to customize your workspace and preferences according to your needs. You can also use keyboard shortcuts and mouse gestures to speed up your work.
 
MestReNova 6.0.2 Pro Portable Fi is not only a powerful tool for NMR processing, but also a versatile tool for other spectroscopic techniques, such as MS (mass spectrometry), IR (infrared spectroscopy), UV-Vis (ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy), and LC/GC (liquid chromatography/gas chromatography). You can combine and correlate data from different sources and methods to get a complete picture of your samples. You can also create reports and presentations with high-quality graphics and tables.
 
If you are looking for a reliable and efficient software for NMR processing and more, MestReNova 6.0.2 Pro Portable Fi is a great choice.

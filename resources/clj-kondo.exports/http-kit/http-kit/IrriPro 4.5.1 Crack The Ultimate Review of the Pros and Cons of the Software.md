## What's New in IrriPro 4.5.1?
 
One of the most requested features on the market is the identification and design of the pump or pump system necessary for the plant. IrriPro 4.5.1 can help you with that by providing you with all the data to identify the most suitable pump in a catalog[^1^].
 
IrriPro 4.5.1 can also consider how a pump and a system work together with maximum precision, verify that both are in the most efficient operating conditions or in any case within acceptable conditions, evaluate an existing pump and what improvements would be made by replacing it with another one, and modify parts of the irrigation system and assess whether a pump continues to be adequate or needs to be replaced[^1^].
 
Another new feature in IrriPro 4.5.1 is the improved management of the layers and the importation of the images. IrriPro 4.5.1 allows you to easily overlay, scale and align, through transparency management, raster images (JPG, BMP, PNG, etc.), vectorial, CAD (in DXF format). Since each content is placed on a different layer, you can decide which layer to activate and which to hide and which to export to other files[^1^].
 
IrriPro 4.5.1 also has an updated automatic network design (for sprinklers / pop-ups / mini-sprinklers) that allows you to improve the alignment of the elements placed between neighboring sectors, improve the coverage of the elements within each sector and avoid the overlap between the appliances[^1^].

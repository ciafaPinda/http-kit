## Dombivli Fast Movie Review: A Gripping Thriller About a Common Man's Fight Against Corruption
 
Dombivli Fast movie is not just a film, but a mirror of the society that we live in. It shows us the harsh reality of how corruption, injustice, and apathy have become a part of our everyday life. It also shows us how one man's courage and conviction can make a difference, even if it comes at a heavy price.
 
The film is directed by Nishikant Kamat, who is known for his realistic and hard-hitting films like Mumbai Meri Jaan, Drishyam, and Madaari. He has also written the screenplay along with Sanjay Pawar, who has also penned the dialogues. The film is inspired by the 1993 Hollywood film Falling Down, starring Michael Douglas, but Kamat has given it an Indian touch and context.
 
The film revolves around Madhav Apte, played by Sandeep Kulkarni, who delivers a brilliant performance as a common man who snaps under pressure. He is a middle-class bank employee who lives in Dombivli, a suburb of Mumbai, with his wife and two children. He is an honest and upright person who believes in following the rules and doing the right thing. He hates corruption and injustice and tries to fight against them in his own way. However, he faces constant frustration and humiliation from his family, friends, colleagues, and society, who do not share his values and morals. His wife accuses him of being impractical and selfish, his boss threatens him of losing his job, his daughter's teacher demands a bribe for admission, his son's friend mocks him for being poor, and so on.
 
One day, he reaches his breaking point and decides to take matters into his own hands. He goes on a rampage across Mumbai to set things right. He confronts the corrupt politicians, bureaucrats, policemen, lawyers, doctors, businessmen, and even common people who are involved in illegal or immoral activities. He uses violence as a means to get justice and make them pay for their crimes. He becomes a vigilante who is wanted by the police and the media. He also meets some people who support him or sympathize with him, such as a journalist, a taxi driver, a beggar, and a retired judge. He realizes that he is not alone in his fight against corruption and injustice.
 
The film has a gripping narrative that keeps the audience hooked till the end. The film also has some powerful scenes that show the reality of Mumbai and its social issues. The film also has some emotional moments that show the human side of Madhav Apte and his family. The film also has some dark humor that lightens up the mood at times. The film also has a strong message that corruption and injustice are not only the problems of the system but also of the people who are part of it.
 
The film also has some drawbacks that could have been avoided. The film sometimes gets preachy and melodramatic in its tone. The film also has some unrealistic and exaggerated scenes that dilute the impact of the film. The film also has some loose ends that are not resolved properly. The film also has some clichÃ©s and stereotypes that are typical of Bollywood films.
 
Overall, Dombivli Fast movie is a gripping thriller that exposes the flaws of the system and the plight of the common man. The film showcases the excellent performance of Sandeep Kulkarni and the direction of Nishikant Kamat. The film is a must-watch for those who want to see a realistic and hard-hitting film that depicts the struggle of a common man against corruption and injustice.
